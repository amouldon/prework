            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            My name is Andrew, I am 19 years old and I am from Illinois.  My hobbies include gaming, watching anime, and getting out into nature.  I love to learn and some of my favorite subjects are astronomy and biology.  I have always loved to build things, and as a kid my room was filled with LEGO sets none of my friends were allowed to touch, haha.

            <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
            <p>
                When I was a kid my favorite game was minecraft, one day when I was probably around 12 I was trying to install a mod to my minecraft world and I opened up some of the files and was taken aback by all the hundreds of lines of code that made absolutely no sense to me. I was really curious on how it worked and soon after at 12 years old, I began my first attempt to learn Java; and I quit after around 15 minutes into my first tutorial haha. A few months ago I heard about software engineering through Tik Tok, and after researching it some, I thought this was the career for me as I love making creative solutions and problem solving, so here I am now. It is cool to think I will soon be able to write programs like the one I stumbled across years ago when I was minecrafting.
